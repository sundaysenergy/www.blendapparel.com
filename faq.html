    <h2 style="color: #808000;">Where have we been?</h2>
<p>It's a bit of a long story, but here goes ... as you will read below in response to another FAQ, Blend Apparel was originally founded by Jon Marro. In 2006, Jon teamed up with Jason Mraz and Jeff Goss, two friends who shared his love of music, art and the environment. Blend was a passion of love then, and it remains the same today. While the company enjoyed many successes during its infancy, in 2011, Jon decided he wanted to take a new direction, and Jason and Jeff supported his decision and continue to support him in that effort. And vice-versa to that ... Jon remains a fan, friend and family member to Blend, Jason and Jeff.  While we will miss Jon's everyday presence at Blend, he is still with us and the company and always will be. We are confident Jon's designs will bless the communitee through his new venture and through Blend. In the meantime, Jason has taken the lead on inspiring the designs for the site and for our amazing friends.</p>
<h2 style="color: #808000;">How long does shipping take?</h2>
<p>We ship out the week’s orders at least every Friday, but usually more often. It may take up to two weeks if you live outside of the States -- or if we’re on vacation, but that should be the longest it takes. We’re a tiny little operation right now, but we are really getting the swing of things. We've had some new members of our family order a shirt on a Friday ... and receive a package of LOVE on the following Monday!</p>
<h2 style="color: #808000;">What kind of critter is that in your logo?</h2>
<p>It’s actually a chameleon. A play on the Jesus Fish/Darwin Amphibian icons you see affixed to backs of cars. As you know, chameleons BLEND in, and Blend Apparel represents a social and fashionable evolutionism.</p>
<h2 style="color: #808000;">How did you decide on the name “Blend Apparel?”</h2>
<p>“Blend Apparel” was originally a response to all the billboards, magazine ads, and commercials dictating what is and isn’t fashionable. “Blend” coincidently, seemed to be the most broad and the most specific definition for what that meant to Jon at the time. He felt like “blending in” was almost a social Darwinism. In order to survive you should conserve your energy, not try to fight it or keep up with the Joneses, but instead be yourself, wear what you think is cool or find fashionable. Ironically, we feel like our designs do anything but blend in. They’re making bold statements, asking bold questions, and are so simply designed, their messages or humor beg you to ponder and construct their meaning. “Wear we live,” the company’s tagline, plays on that transparency.</p>
<h2 style="color: #808000;">Where did your first inspiration come from?/How did you get started?</h2>
<p>Jon was designing a ton of merchandise for bands and musicians, and really enjoying it, but there were a few images that he wanted to put out there into the world without someone’s name attached to it. So, he initially started with four designs. The first of which was “Love Fuel.” Someone once referred to him as a full-service love station. He took it as a pretty great compliment and the image on the back of the shirt first came to mind, and then he added the front “Love Pump.” Pairing images and icons like that to give new meanings to banal objects is a fairly constant theme in his work. With Jason and Jeff's help, those four designs grew to more than twenty in less than a year. Some of them will be back on Blend, but for now, we've taken some of Jason's art, blogs and unique perspective on life and created the three shirts seen on the site at its relaunch. Two more small lines are in the planning stages, with production to begin in mid-Summer.</p>
<h2 style="color: #808000;">Who are the people involved?</h2>
<p>As announced last year, Blend has undergone a business evolution (not to be confused with a business separation), and Jon Marro (Blend's founder) is starting a sister company of sorts. The amazing new designs (and the ones to follow shortly) are the offspring of Jason Mraz. He has taken on the design inspiration role Jon used to fulfill for Blend (big shoes to fill, to be sure ... but Jason's a pretty inspiring guy), and he continues in his role as the one-man marketing machine by wearing the shirts on his musical and self-awakening tours around the globe. Jeff Goss the former $ituation Handler (other companies refer to that position as the General Counsel) now has the enviable role of putting Jason's doodles and concepts and off-the-wall ideas onto organic cotton via water-based inks ... and then getting them to you. Yep, that's it -- a shoestring operation that strives to Blend commerce, community and compassion for the environment.  Blend Apparel never was and never will be a company focused solely on the bottom line. Rather, it's a company that focuses on how to inspire people to question art, life, the environment and the interaction among the people of this wonderful world we call Earth. More than fifty percent of our business has historically been from international friends, and we consider Blend to be a world company. Jason, Jeff and Jon were all friends before we became business partners, and we remain friends to this day!! Which brings up an important point -- the best part of Blend Apparel is the friends we've made around the world through our shared passion for compassion -- for the environment, our world and its people.</p>
<h2 style="color: #808000;">Explain Jason's designs- How do you describe his art?</h2>
<p>That's a tough question to answer, but Jason's designs are much like his songs. With song, he takes his experiences in life, and captures and expresses those experience in word and music. The designs he's inspired for Blend are also driven by his life experiences and the musings of his mind.  Like Jon's designs, some are meant solely to bring a smile or levity, others intend to raise awareness or self-love.</p>
<h2 style="color: #808000;">Who or what inspires Jason Mraz's imagery?</h2>
<p>The universe. The world he has experienced by the blessings of his mind and music. Humanity, and international icons also play a role. But you are the best "decider" of what inspires Jason's art, for it speaks to each in a singular way.</p>
<h2 style="color: #808000;">Why no more bamboo??</h2>
<p>Although our shirts were originally a blend of bamboo (70%) and organic cotton (30%), we began transitioning to an unbelievable organic cotton shirt in the Fall of 2009. At the same time, we learned more about questions with the process used to transform bamboo into fabric. Though bamboo is arguably Earth's most sustainable plant, and plays a critically important role in other markets, we decided the chemical process used in creating the fabric outweighed bamboo's many other positive aspects. We believe there will soon be a day when a new process is developed that allows bamboo material to bless bodies everywhere.  But until then, we decided to use organic cotton as the canvas for Jason's art.</p>
<h2 style="color: #808000;">What is important to you about conservation and preserving our environment?</h2>
<p>Well, we think most importantly this planet is all that we have. And that as a species, we’re in an abusive relationship, often with ourselves as well as the planet. We were born into this beautiful and divinely perfect situation: air to breathe, and sunlight to keep us warm already abundantly provided. Soil to plant food, fresh water to drink. Without getting too biblical-Earth was the Garden of Eden, and we’re completely taking it for granted. We can live such a life of harmony with it, if we use it in sustainable ways. But we need to think of the whole picture. Just pan back to space and see Earth from above. That’s what we’re dealing with. We’re all in this and on this together. It’s kinda that simple. Why not celebrate and share as opposed to separate and scorn? These are the questions we're trying to ask.</p>
<h2 style="color: #808000;">What advice would you give a young artist just getting started?</h2>
<p>Create! Create! Create! (While being mindful of the path you walk and wake you leave of course.)</p>
